# peakfinder

designed to find the hyper-parameter for max accuracy of a NN. This is probably a worse copy of some sort of search algo but I pass-failed my algo class so i dont really know lmao

designed to find the "peak" of a based on a parameter += 1, note that this is not guraenteed to be the highest value as there can be multiple peaks within a set of data
